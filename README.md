## Lyrics Fetching
The player includes a placeholder for lyrics fetching using an API. You can integrate a lyrics API like Genius or Musixmatch:
- Update the `fetch_lyrics` method in the code with your API key and endpoint.

Example (using Genius API):
```python
def fetch_lyrics(self, title, artist):
    api_url = "https://api.genius.com/search"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
    params = {"q": f"{title} {artist}"}
    response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)
    # Extract lyrics from the response
```

## Known Issues
- Album art display depends on the presence of embedded images in the audio metadata.
- Lyrics fetching API integration requires an API key and configuration.
